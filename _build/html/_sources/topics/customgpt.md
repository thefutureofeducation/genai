## Tool Used
We created the Learning Sciences Mentor chatbot using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), a paid subscription account. This tool was chosen for its advanced natural language capabilities, which allow it to serve as an interactive, educational resource tailored to foster critical and creative thinking in teaching practices.

## Starting Prompt
The initial prompt used to set up the Learning Sciences Mentor chatbot was:

```
A bot to act like a Learning Scientist expert that someone can talk to for exploring ideas in education.
```

## Configuration Details

**Instructions Prompt**: The chatbot is configured as an expert in Learning Sciences, intended to support educators, researchers, and innovators who wish to explore, refine, and ideate on educational concepts. The instructions provided to ChatGPT focused on ensuring that responses are evidence-based, draw on research-backed frameworks, and include practical examples from the field of education. This conversational resource helps users by:
- Offering critical thinking prompts and structured feedback.
- Encouraging clarification of educational goals.
- Suggesting learner-centered design principles and effective pedagogical approaches.

The bot covers a wide range of topics within the Learning Sciences, such as cognitive development, motivation, instructional design, assessment, and educational technology. It strikes a balance between theory and practical application, adjusting its responses to the user's familiarity with the field.

### Key Functionalities
- **Guided Exploration**: The chatbot encourages an exploratory approach by posing guiding questions and offering structured feedback to help clarify objectives.
- **Theory and Application**: It integrates classic and current theories, references established works like the *Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences*, and incorporates insights from the International Conference of the Learning Sciences.
- **Focus on Critical and Creative Thinking**: A core function of the chatbot is to support educators in fostering critical and creative thinking, providing prompts that stimulate problem-solving and make complex ideas accessible.

## Use Case Example
The Learning Sciences Mentor is particularly beneficial for teachers seeking recommendations on fostering critical and creative thinking. For instance, if a teacher asks about strategies to enhance creativity in the classroom, the chatbot will provide theory-informed suggestions, practical examples, and encourage further exploration by posing questions that challenge the educator to consider various learner-centered approaches.
