# Game - AI Decision Quest

## Tool Used
We created this interactive game resource using [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude). These tools were chosen for their advanced features and ability to collaboratively generate creative and educational content, making them ideal for designing an interactive learning experience.

## Part 1 (ChatGPT)

### Generation Prompt
The prompt we used to create this resource was:

```
Could you think of an idea for an interactive game that would be based on the discussions observed in the attached PDFs 
and considering the leading question for the activity "How can technology be helpful or harmful to students' critical 
thinking skills? In what ways, can we create a future that better fosters critical and creative thinking?" 
```

This prompt was designed to [brief explanation of why this prompt was chosen, e.g., ensure comprehensive coverage of the topic, encourage creativity, etc.].

Can you please help me with an interactive game based on the following idea described below?

"Pathways to Critical Thinkers: The AI Decision Quest." This game would challenge students to make decisions about how to use technology in various scenarios, helping them develop a balanced understanding of technology's benefits and drawbacks for critical thinking.
Game Concept
Game Title: Pathways to Critical Thinkers: The AI Decision Quest Game Format: Role-playing, choice-based game (Playable on computers, tablets, or as a classroom activity) Target Audience: Students aged 12 and up
Game Mechanics
* Roles and Scenarios: Players assume the roles of students, educators, or tech designers. Each role has unique scenarios that present technology’s potential impact on critical thinking.
* Decision Points: At each stage, players are presented with realistic scenarios where they must make choices that either encourage or discourage critical thinking. Each choice impacts their pathway in the game.
* Reflection Moments: After each major decision, players receive a prompt encouraging reflection. This prompt might ask, “How did this choice impact critical thinking?” or “What risks might come with this choice?”
* Scoreboard or Growth Tracker: Players accumulate "Critical Thinker Points" by making choices that foster critical thinking. However, choices that lean towards over-reliance on technology or passive consumption can lead to negative points or “Bias Alerts.”
Example Scenarios
1. Scenario 1 – AI-Assisted Homework Objective: Encourage active engagement with technology. Description: The player must choose how they would use an AI homework assistant. Options might include:
   * Using AI solely to check answers.
   * Asking AI to explain reasoning behind answers.
   * Combining AI with personal research to verify and expand understanding.
   * Each choice affects how much the player’s critical thinking skills improve and may lead to different learning outcomes.
2. Scenario 2 – Classroom Debate with AI Objective: Develop skills in healthy scepticism and questioning. Description: The player participates in a classroom debate where AI provides facts for each side. Choices could involve:
   * Accepting AI-generated information without question.
   * Fact-checking AI’s claims using additional resources.
   * Using AI’s response as a starting point to challenge opposing views.
   * Points are awarded for using AI critically and not passively accepting all information at face value.
3. Scenario 3 – Designing an AI Tool for Schools Objective: Highlight ethical and practical considerations in AI design. Description: As a future tech designer, the player must decide which features to include in a new AI tool for education. Options might involve:
   * Creating an AI that gives direct answers.
   * Designing an AI that asks probing questions to encourage student reflection.
   * Adding a feature for students to cross-check facts.
   * The player is rewarded for choices that promote questioning, critical thinking, and responsible AI use.
Game Ending and Reflection
* Final Assessment: The game ends with a summary of the player’s decisions and an analysis of how well they promoted critical thinking skills.
* Reflection Session: Players can discuss their experiences with peers, facilitated by prompts like, “Which choices felt hardest? Why?” and “How might your decisions change the role of technology in learning?”
Educational Benefits
This game encourages students to engage deeply with technology’s role in education, emphasizing that responsible, mindful use of AI fosters critical thinking. It aligns with the discussion from the PDF by embedding themes like scepticism, active questioning, and balanced tech engagement.

## Reflection on Educational Use
This interactive game offers both educators and students a hands-on approach to exploring the complexities of technology's role in critical thinking. By simulating real-world scenarios and decision points, the game encourages students to actively engage with the content, helping them understand not only the benefits but also the potential pitfalls of using AI in educational contexts.

For educators, this game serves as an effective tool to facilitate deeper discussions on digital literacy and critical thinking. By guiding students through situations that require thoughtful decision-making, educators can foster reflective learning and encourage students to question and evaluate information critically. Additionally, the game provides a structured way to introduce topics such as ethical AI use, the importance of healthy scepticism, and the balance between leveraging technology and maintaining independent analytical skills.

For students, this game transforms abstract concepts into tangible experiences. As they navigate each scenario, students practice making intentional choices about how to interact with technology, developing skills that are essential for navigating digital environments both inside and outside the classroom. The game’s design emphasizes the importance of questioning AI-generated information, seeking multiple sources, and reflecting on their decision-making process—key aspects of cultivating a critical mindset.

Ultimately, resources like this can play a transformative role in education by shifting traditional, passive learning methods towards interactive, student-centered experiences. By embedding critical thinking skills directly into the gameplay, the game not only fosters engagement but also equips students with strategies for responsible technology use, preparing them for a future where they can navigate the digital landscape thoughtfully and effectively.
