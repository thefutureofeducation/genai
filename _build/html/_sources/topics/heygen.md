# HeyGen Avatar

## Tool Used
We created the GenAI avatar video using [HeyGen](https://heygen.com/), a freemium platform with subscription options, which allows for creating a certain number of videos for free. Additionally, we used [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) to refine the script for our avatar, enhancing its engagement and suitability for the event audience.

## Generation Process

### Part 1 – Lecture Script Writing
First, we drafted the lecture script and then used ChatGPT to enhance it, making it more engaging and suited for an oral presentation. The prompt used was:

```
I am using a GenAI avatar of myself during a talk. The talk is in an event called 
"the Future of Education." The audience is a mix of academics, media, and teachers. 
I need you to rewrite a script to give my GenAI avatar. In the script, the GenAI 
avatar introduces itself and introduces the next activity. Please rewrite to optimise 
the script for an oral presentation that is highly engaging. Here is the draft of 
the script.
```
