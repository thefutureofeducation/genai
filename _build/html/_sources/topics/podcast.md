# Podcast

## Tool Used
We created this resource using [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com/). This tool was chosen for its intuitive interface and its advanced capabilities in managing and analysing large sets of notes and information, which make it ideal for synthesising key ideas from educational discussions.

## Generation Process
This Podcast was created using NotebookLM, which did not require a specific prompt. The tool automatically extracted and summarised key insights from discussions on the impact of technology, particularly AI, on students' critical thinking skills.


## The Resource (Output - Audience, the Future of Education Event - 16mins49secs)

```
This excerpt from a transcript discusses the potential impact of AI on 
students' critical thinking skills. The speakers, an educator and an AI 
chatbot, explore whether AI could be a tool to enhance critical thinking 
by encouraging skepticism and questioning of information, much like a 
Socratic dialogue. They acknowledge the risk of AI providing potentially 
biased or misleading information, but ultimately argue that AI can be a 
valuable tool for developing critical thinking skills, provided it is used 
in a way that encourages questioning and healthy skepticism.

## Reflection on Educational Use

This type of resource can be a powerful tool for both educators and students. Educators can use NotebookLM to streamline note-taking, extract essential points, and design discussion-based learning around complex topics such as the role of technology in education. This can enhance engagement and facilitate deeper, reflective learning.

For students, this resource offers a way to reinforce understanding through structured summaries and audio discussions, providing alternative perspectives and encouraging active listening. By using NotebookLM in combination with audio resources, students can engage in interactive learning that enhances retention and understanding.

We believe that resources like this can transform traditional learning methods by promoting collaborative exploration and critical engagement. Such tools help bridge learning gaps by making abstract concepts tangible, fostering an environment where both educators and students can thrive in an evolving digital landscape.
