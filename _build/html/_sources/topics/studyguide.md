#### Short-Answer Quiz: Answer Key

1. The rise of AI is prompting a re-evaluation of traditional critical thinking teaching methods. Educators are considering whether these methods are sufficient in an AI-dominated world and exploring ways to adapt, such as teaching students to critique and build upon AI-generated responses.
2. Two potential risks are dependency and stifled creativity. Students may become overly reliant on AI for answers, bypassing their own learning and critical analysis. Also, overuse of AI tools like ChatGPT could lead to a lack of originality and individual voice in creative outputs.
3. "AI literacy" refers to the ability to use AI tools effectively and responsibly, understanding their capabilities, limitations, and potential biases. It's crucial because students need to be equipped to navigate an increasingly AI-driven world and make informed decisions about AI's use.
4. The debate on AI's role in education has two sides: some argue against AI use, fearing it hinders critical and creative thinking. Others advocate for "guided AI use," believing AI can enhance learning if students are taught to refine AI outputs to reflect their own voice and creativity.
5. AI can serve as a creative inspiration tool by exposing students to a wider range of ideas and perspectives than they might encounter on their own. This can spark new ideas and encourage them to think outside their usual frameworks.
6. The challenge is the overwhelming amount of digital information, making it difficult to discern credible sources from unreliable ones. A best practice is to encourage scepticism towards unverified content and emphasise the importance of seeking information from reputable sources.
7. It's crucial because students are constantly bombarded with information online, and they need the skills to evaluate the credibility of sources, identify biases, and determine the accuracy of information before accepting it as truth.
8. Socratic questioning encourages students to think deeply and critically about their own beliefs and the information they encounter. By asking probing questions, teachers can guide students to examine their assumptions, consider different perspectives, and arrive at well-reasoned conclusions.
9. The speaker believes that AI is not inherently harmful or helpful to critical thinking. They argue that it depends on how AI is used and emphasise that students should be taught to question and challenge all information sources, whether from AI or humans.
10. One innovative approach is "AI as a Thought Partner." AI can be designed to challenge students' assumptions and present alternative viewpoints, prompting them to think more deeply and critically about a topic.

#### Essay Questions

1. Analyse the potential benefits and drawbacks of integrating AI tools like ChatGPT into education. Discuss how educators can mitigate the risks while maximising the potential of AI to enhance critical thinking skills.
2. Explain the importance of teaching media literacy alongside critical thinking skills in today's digital landscape. Provide specific examples of how these skills can empower students to navigate the complexities of online information.
3. Evaluate the argument that over-reliance on AI could lead to a decline in students' creativity and originality. Discuss strategies educators can implement to foster individual voice and creative expression in an AI-driven world.
4. Based on the provided transcript, critically analyse the speaker's perspective on AI's role in critical thinking development. Do you agree or disagree with their viewpoint? Justify your position with evidence and examples.
5. Imagine you are designing an educational program aimed at fostering critical thinking and AI literacy in students. Describe the key elements and learning activities of your program, addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by AI in education.
