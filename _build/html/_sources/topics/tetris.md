# Game - AI Learning Tetris

## Tool Used
We created this interactive Tetris game resource using [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude). 

## Generation Prompt
The prompt we used to create this resource was:

```
Can we have a traditional game of tetris but whenever the player scores a point, we provide a little scenario involving the use of AI and critical thinking to allow them to learn something new in that domain? The game should record current and higher score of the user.

Please add various scenarios to it. 
Once the user provides an answer to the AI prompt, please let them know if their answer is correct or not, and explain why. 

Lastly, the game should become more difficult with time.
```

## Reflection on Educational Use
Resources like this can play a transformative role in education by shifting traditional, passive learning methods towards interactive, student-centered experiences. By embedding critical thinking skills directly into the gameplay, the game not only fosters engagement but also equips students with strategies for responsible technology use, preparing them for a future where they can navigate the digital landscape thoughtfully and effectively.
