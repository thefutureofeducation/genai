### AI and its Impact on Critical Thinking in Students

This briefing doc analyses a conversation exploring the potential impact of AI on the critical thinking skills of students. The main themes discussed include:

1. **The Importance of Questioning**  
   The core message is that fostering critical thinking relies on encouraging students to question information instead of passively accepting it. This aligns with the Socratic method of teaching.  
   _"Students need to be asked questions, not to be told how to think. We need to use a lot more Socratic questioning with kids to encourage them to think and to challenge their own thought processes."_

2. **AI as a Tool for Discussion**  
   The conversation proposes that AI, when used correctly, can be a tool to stimulate critical thinking by engaging students in discussions rather than simply providing answers.  
   _"If we embed things into AI software or we teach kids how to ask AI software to engage with them in discussion rather than just giving answers."_

3. **Fostering Healthy Skepticism**  
   A key takeaway is the need to cultivate a healthy skepticism in students, regardless of the information source, be it AI or a potentially biased teacher.  
   _"You encourage a healthy skepticism in kids. Parenting and the education system sets them up to have a healthy skepticism and not to just believe everything, even if it sounds convincing."_

4. **AI as a Mirror to Existing Challenges**  
   The discussion highlights that the potential pitfalls of AI in influencing students' thinking are similar to the challenges posed by biased information sources that already exist.  
   _"I don't think it's any different to if you had a very biased teacher who was very un-self-aware… who's just telling them things and they're straight up believing it."_

5. **AI's Potential to Support Critical Thinking**  
   While acknowledging potential risks, the conversation emphasises that AI, depending on how it's used, can be a valuable tool to support and enhance critical thinking skills.  
   _"It depends how it's engaged with... You can engage with AI in a very unhelpful way or you can learn how to engage with it in a way that is going to help you."_

### Key Insights

- The fundamental principles of fostering critical thinking remain crucial in the age of AI.
- AI's potential impact on critical thinking hinges on its application and how students are taught to interact with it.
- Cultivating healthy skepticism and teaching students to engage in thoughtful questioning are essential to mitigate potential risks and leverage AI's benefits.
  
This conversation emphasises the importance of thoughtful integration of AI in education, focusing on utilising it as a tool to enhance critical thinking rather than a source of readily accepted answers.

## Reflection on Educational Use
This briefing document serves as an insightful resource for educators, providing a focused analysis of AI's impact on critical thinking in education. For **educators**, it highlights essential strategies, such as fostering a questioning mindset, nurturing healthy skepticism, and using AI as a tool to encourage discussion rather than merely supplying answers. These strategies can be incorporated into lesson plans to deepen students' analytical skills and critical engagement with digital tools.

For **students**, this document offers a roadmap for engaging with AI critically and responsibly. By understanding the need for skepticism and learning how to question information from all sources, students can develop habits of independent, thoughtful inquiry that will serve them well both in and outside the classroom.

We believe that resources like this can support a future where AI is used to complement, not replace, traditional critical thinking methods. By encouraging both educators and students to approach AI with intention and discernment, this resource fosters a balanced and proactive approach to technology in learning environments.
