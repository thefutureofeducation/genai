### AI and its Impact on Critical Thinking in Students

This briefing doc analyses a conversation exploring the potential impact of AI on the critical thinking skills of students. The main themes discussed include:

1. **The Importance of Questioning**  
   The core message is that fostering critical thinking relies on encouraging students to question information instead of passively accepting it. This aligns with the Socratic method of teaching.  
   _"Students need to be asked questions, not to be told how to think. We need to use a lot more Socratic questioning with kids to encourage them to think and to challenge their own thought processes."_

2. **AI as a Tool for Discussion**  
   The conversation proposes that AI, when used correctly, can be a tool to stimulate critical thinking by engaging students in discussions rather than simply providing answers.  
   _"If we embed things into AI software or we teach kids how to ask AI software to engage with them in discussion rather than just giving answers."_

3. **Fostering Healthy Skepticism**  
   A key takeaway is the need to cultivate a healthy skepticism in students, regardless of the information source, be it AI or a potentially biased teacher.  
   _"You encourage a healthy skepticism in kids. Parenting and the education system sets them up to have a healthy skepticism and not to just believe everything, even if it sounds convincing."_

4. **AI as a Mirror to Existing Challenges**  
   The discussion highlights that the potential pitfalls of AI in influencing students' thinking are similar to the challenges posed by biased information sources that already exist.  
   _"I don't think it's any different to if you had a very biased teacher who was very un-self-aware… who's just telling them things and they're straight up believing it."_

5. **AI's Potential to Support Critical Thinking**  
   While acknowledging potential risks, the conversation emphasises that AI, depending on how it's used, can be a valuable tool to support and enhance critical thinking skills.  
   _"It depends how it's engaged with... You can engage with AI in a very unhelpful way or you can learn how to engage with it in a way that is going to help you."_

### Critical and Creative Thinking in Learning Sciences

Main Themes:

- The Interplay of Critical and Creative Thinking: These skills are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary and essential for effective learning, problem-solving, and innovation. Critical thinking provides the analytical framework to refine and evaluate creative ideas, while creative thinking generates novel approaches that can be further scrutinised and developed through critical analysis.
- Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning: Individuals who can monitor their own thinking processes, set goals, and adapt strategies are better equipped to engage in both critical and creative thinking. This self-awareness allows learners to identify biases, evaluate evidence effectively, and persist in challenging tasks.
- The Transformative Role of Technology: Technology can be a powerful tool for fostering both critical and creative thinking by providing access to diverse perspectives, facilitating collaboration, enabling simulations and experimentation, and encouraging reflection and iteration. However, its implementation requires intentionality to avoid passive consumption and promote deep engagement.
- Collaborative Learning Environments: Group work, discussions, and shared projects provide opportunities for learners to challenge ideas, refine arguments, and build on collective knowledge, enhancing both critical and creative thinking.
- Authentic Learning Experiences: By engaging students in real-world problem-solving, inquiry-based activities, and project-based learning, educators can create meaningful contexts for developing and applying critical and creative thinking skills.

Most Important Ideas/Facts:

1. **Key Components of Critical Thinking (Halpern)**:

- Problem Identification and Goal Setting: Recognising and clearly defining the problem is crucial for effective critical thinking. As Halpern states, "without a well-defined problem, it’s challenging to create effective solutions."
- Argument Analysis: Critically analysing arguments involves identifying premises and conclusions, detecting fallacies, and assessing logical flow.
- Evidence Evaluation: Critical thinkers carefully consider the quality, relevance, and validity of evidence, distinguishing between correlation and causation, understanding statistics, and recognising biases.
- Decision-Making Strategies: Employing strategies like cost-benefit analysis and recognising heuristics help individuals make well-reasoned decisions even in uncertain situations.

2. **Metacognition and Self-Regulated Learning (Azevedo and Winne)**:

- Goal Setting: Setting clear and achievable goals provides learners with direction and allows them to measure their progress.
- Monitoring and Self-Assessment: Self-regulated learners continuously monitor their understanding, evaluate their progress, and identify areas for improvement.
- Strategy Use and Adaptation: They are flexible in their approach, adapting strategies based on the task demands and their own learning needs.
- Reflection and Evaluation: Critical reflection on their methods and outcomes allows learners to refine their understanding and improve future performance.

3. **Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) (Stahl, Koschmann, and Suthers)**:

- Shared Knowledge Construction: CSCL emphasises the collaborative process of building knowledge, encouraging learners to engage critically with content, examine diverse viewpoints, and synthesise new understandings.
- Interactivity and Communication: Technology facilitates dynamic interaction and communication among learners, supporting critical thinking through questioning, constructive debate, and reflective discourse.
- Distributed Cognition and Collective Intelligence: Knowledge and thinking are distributed across the group, fostering collective intelligence and creative problem-solving through the integration of multiple perspectives and skills.
- Scaffolding and Structuring of Activities: Carefully designed activities and instructor guidance support learners in developing critical and creative thinking skills through structured collaboration.

4. **Creative Thinking as a Process (Sawyer)**:

- Divergent Thinking: Generating a wide range of ideas and possibilities is crucial for exploring new solutions.
- Convergent Thinking: Evaluating and refining ideas to select the most promising approaches.
- Incremental Refinement: Creative outcomes often result from continuous improvement and iteration, building upon existing knowledge and ideas.
- Collaboration: The social dynamic of sharing, discussing, and evolving ideas in group settings significantly enhances creativity.

5. **Recommendations for Fostering Creativity in Education (Sawyer)**:

- Encourage collaborative learning environments.
- Implement project-based learning that engages students in real-world challenges.
- Cultivate a “Yes, and…” classroom culture to promote open idea sharing and risk-taking.
- Integrate reflective practices to encourage metacognition and continuous improvement.
- Build resilience and problem-solving skills.
- Balance structure with freedom to provide guidance while allowing creative autonomy.
- Use technology to support collaboration and iteration.

6. **Designing Technology-Rich Educational Activities (Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences)**:

- Project-based learning with digital tools.
- Interactive simulations for problem-solving.
- Collaborative digital environments.
- Scaffolded reflection through digital portfolios.
- Inquiry-based learning supported by online research tools.
- Game-based learning for scenario exploration.

#### Quotes

- "Critical thinking is 'purposeful, reasoned, and goal-directed thinking.'" (Halpern)
- "Self-regulated learning is an active, constructive process in which learners set goals, monitor their progress, and adjust strategies to achieve their objectives." (Azevedo and Winne)
- "CSCL is rooted in the idea that learning is inherently social and that technology can support the processes through which groups create and share knowledge." (Stahl, Koschmann, and Suthers)
- "Creativity is less about sudden 'aha' moments and more about sustained, collaborative, and reflective work." (Sawyer)
- "Technology has the potential to broaden access to information, facilitate collaboration, and provide tools for simulation and experimentation—all of which support critical and creative thinking." (Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences)
