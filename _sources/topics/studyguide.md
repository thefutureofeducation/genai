### AI & Critical Thinking in Education: Study Guide

#### I. Key Concepts:
- **Socratic Questioning**: A method of teaching that uses a series of questions to guide students to discover answers and insights on their own, rather than simply providing them with information.
- **Healthy Skepticism**: An attitude of questioning and critically evaluating information, rather than simply accepting it at face value.
- **AI Bias**: The potential for artificial intelligence systems to reflect and perpetuate the biases present in the data they are trained on.
- **Student Agency in AI Use**: The importance of teaching students how to effectively and critically use AI tools, rather than simply being passive consumers of AI-generated content.

#### II. Short Answer Questions:
1. According to the speaker, how should students interact with information they encounter, regardless of its source?
2. Why does the speaker believe that Socratic questioning is important for developing critical thinking skills?
3. How does the speaker compare the potential dangers of AI bias to the influence of a biased teacher?
4. Explain the concept of "healthy skepticism" and its role in navigating information in the age of AI.
5. How can AI be used to help students develop critical thinking skills, according to the speaker?
6. What is the speaker's stance on whether AI is inherently harmful or helpful to critical thinking?
7. How does the speaker suggest students should engage with AI to maximise its benefits for learning?
8. According to the speaker, who holds the responsibility for ensuring that AI is used effectively in education?
9. What does the speaker mean by stating that "AI is only ever going to do what you ask it to do"?
10. In your own words, summarise the main points of the speaker's perspective on the relationship between AI and critical thinking in education.

#### III. Short Answer Key:
1. Students should always question and challenge the information they encounter, regardless of whether it comes from a teacher, a book, or an AI system. They should not simply accept information at face value.
2. Socratic questioning encourages students to think for themselves and to arrive at their own conclusions. It helps them develop the ability to analyse information, identify assumptions, and construct well-reasoned arguments.
3. The speaker suggests that a biased AI system poses similar dangers to a biased teacher. Both can present information in a skewed way, potentially leading students to accept inaccurate or incomplete information.
4. Healthy skepticism is the practice of questioning information and looking for evidence before accepting it as true. This is crucial in the age of AI because AI systems can generate highly convincing content, even if it is false or misleading.
5. AI can be used to facilitate discussions, provide feedback on student work, and generate prompts that encourage critical thinking. It can also be used to expose students to different perspectives and challenge their assumptions.
6. The speaker believes that AI is neither inherently harmful nor helpful to critical thinking. Its impact depends on how it is used. AI can be a valuable tool for promoting critical thinking if it is used intentionally and thoughtfully.
7. Students should learn to use AI as a tool for exploration and inquiry. They should not rely on AI to provide answers, but rather use it to generate questions, gather information, and test their own ideas.
8. The responsibility for ensuring the effective use of AI in education lies with both educators and parents. Educators need to teach students how to use AI critically, while parents need to instill in their children a healthy skepticism towards all information sources.
9. The speaker emphasises that AI is a tool, and like any tool, it can be used for good or bad purposes. The way AI is used depends entirely on the intentions and instructions of the user.
10. The speaker argues that AI has the potential to both enhance and hinder critical thinking in education. It is crucial to approach AI with a healthy skepticism and to teach students how to use it effectively as a tool for learning and inquiry.

#### IV. Essay Questions:
1. Analyse the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating AI into educational settings, focusing on its impact on students' critical thinking skills.
2. Discuss the ethical implications of using AI in education, considering issues such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the potential for AI to exacerbate existing inequalities.
3. Evaluate the speaker's argument that AI is "only ever going to do what you ask it to do." To what extent is this statement true? What are the implications for the design and use of AI systems in education?
4. Develop a lesson plan for a high school or college-level course that uses AI to promote critical thinking in a specific subject area. Be sure to address potential challenges and mitigation strategies.
5. Imagine a future where AI plays a significant role in education. What are the key challenges and opportunities that educators, policymakers, and society as a whole will need to address to ensure that AI is used ethically and effectively to support student learning and development?

#### V. Glossary of Key Terms:
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.
- **Critical Thinking**: The objective analysis and evaluation of an issue in order to form a judgment. It involves skills such as interpreting information, identifying assumptions, recognising biases, and constructing well-reasoned arguments.
- **Algorithm**: A set of rules or instructions that a computer follows to solve a problem or perform a task.
- **Bias**: Prejudice in favor of or against one thing, person, or group compared with another, usually in a way considered to be unfair. In the context of AI, bias refers to systematic errors in AI systems that can result in unfair or inaccurate outcomes.
- **Socratic Method**: A form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions.

## Reflection on Educational Use
This study guide can be an invaluable tool for both educators and students. For **educators**, it provides a structured outline for introducing key topics in AI and critical thinking, encouraging students to delve into complex issues. Educators can use these questions to guide classroom discussions, foster deeper analytical skills, and encourage students to examine ethical considerations and biases in AI.

For **students**, this guide serves as a comprehensive resource to understand and critically engage with AI. By exploring short-answer and essay questions, students can practice articulating their thoughts, challenge assumptions, and develop a nuanced understanding of AI's impact on education and critical thinking. The glossary of terms further enhances their comprehension, providing a foundation for informed discussions.

We believe that resources like this can support interactive and reflective learning, equipping students to navigate an AI-driven world responsibly. By fostering skills in skepticism, inquiry, and analysis, resources like this guide can help students develop the competencies needed to approach technology thoughtfully and make informed, critical decisions.
