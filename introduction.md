## What is this About? AI Resources Showcase from the Future of Education Melbourne Connect Event

During the Future of Education event at Melbourne Connect (Nov 13, 5pm-7.30pm), we developed this Jupyter Notebook to demonstrate practical applications of AI tools in promoting education. This specific project demonstrations was structured into two key parts:

**Part 1:** We gathered real-time data from participants, sparking discussion and reflection on three pivotal questions:
1. Does AI stifle creativity, or enhance it?
2. Does AI prevent critical thinking, or foster it?
3. Does AI remove barriers between vocational and higher education, or increase them?

To support our analysis, we collected transcripts from select group discussions.

In 25 minutes, we applied various AI tools to transform these insights into multiple resources, including thematic visualisations, podcasts, and interactive games. 

**Part 2:** These resources, which highlighted the responsiveness, inclusiveness, and adaptability of AI in educational contexts, were made accessible and presented to all participants for further exploration (during the event). We collected data in Part 1, took 25mins to produce these resources while the event was happening, and returned at the end of the event to showcase this resource hub to participants.


**Disclaimer:** _Please note that, due to the rapid pace of content generation during this activity, we did not have the opportunity to fully validate the accuracy of all outputs. The primary goal of this session was to showcase the potential applications of AI in educational settings, rather than to create rigorously verified learning content. We encourage participants to view these outputs as exploratory demonstrations of AIâ€™s capabilities_.
