# Game - Snake AI (Kids)

## Tool Used
We created this interactive game to teach kids on how to use AI responsibly resource using [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude). 

## Generation Prompt
The prompt we used to create this resource was:

```
Can you make a snake like game for primary school kids to play, including current and higher score as a feature. Every time they score, lets teach them on responsible AI. Also, the snake should move faster as they score more points, making it harder as the snake gets longer.
```

## Reflection on Educational Use
Resources like this can play a transformative role in education by shifting traditional, passive learning methods towards interactive, student-centered experiences. By embedding critical thinking skills directly into the gameplay, the game not only fosters engagement but also equips students with strategies for responsible technology use, preparing them for a future where they can navigate the digital landscape thoughtfully and effectively.
